    continue adding the movement script for all directions.
    I may need to rework the motion add function as you tend to be
    very slippery. Also need to work in the jumping animations tied
    to what direction you are moving. I may decide to put that into
    the same script with the movement. perhaps. I dunno.
    
    
    TO DO:
    Still need to work on the battle system,            []
    Getting collisions to work sightly better,          [xish]
    Disable movement while jumping,                     [xish]
    Abstract controls so they are rebindable            []
    Continue cleaning the enviroment a bit              [WIP]
    Trying to figure out how to get each ollie
    animation to correctly display depending 
    on the degrees!!!!!                                 [x]
    
    Improved the movement. It's passable by now. DOWN still needs
    animation. Collision was slightly fixed by changing the origin
    of the sprite. Cleaned a little bit. Still need to make it so 
    you can't instantly reverse direction. Kick animation needs to be
    synced so that when you begin moving it starts at a kick. The easiest
    approach seems to be changing the actual frames around. 
    
    Battle system will include not only simple tricks with directional
    input but also combos with string system I have previously 
    entertained. I need to figure out a special move to add so I can test
    it.
    
    In the battle system I would like opponents side by side as the
    backgroung scrolls and each of them will be tricking. There will be
    a "ollie" bar showing how high you can ollie. Each button should
    correspond with an onscreen button appearing and when player inputs
    combos they should either light up or change to the name of the combo.
    
    If either npc or player bails they should fall on the ground and slide
    off screen and then roll back up to meet the challenger. Each successive
    trick and combo will reduce the opposing member's hp until 0.
    The party with 0 hp will be the loser. Once battles end player will be 
    rewarded somehow with either acsess to new tricks or compensation Or not.
